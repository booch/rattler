# Rattler

**Parsing for Ruby that's so easy it feels like cheating.**

Rattler is a parser generator for Ruby based on parsing expression grammars.
Rattler's purpose is to make language design and recognition as simple and fun
as possible. To that end, the normal parsing expression grammar syntax is
extended with simple features to overcome some of the limitations of pure
PEG grammars.
